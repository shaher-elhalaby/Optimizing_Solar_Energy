# Optmizing_Solar_Energy
-It optimizes solar energy by moving the panel to towards the sun.
-the control is applied by two methods:
•	Open loop: by using coordinates and time to locate the sun.
•	Closed loop: by using sensors to locate sun.
*By applying these methods, the panel can get maximum efficiency from the sun Energy.
